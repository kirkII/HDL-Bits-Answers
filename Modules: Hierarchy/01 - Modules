// In this exercise, create one instance of module mod_a, then connect the module's three pins (in1, in2, and out) to your top-level module's 
// three ports (wires a, b, and out). The module mod_a is provided for you â€” you must instantiate it.
// See https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Module for reference.

module top_module (
	input a,
	input b,
	output out
);

	// Create an instance of "mod_a" named "inst0", and connect ports by name:
	mod_a inst0 ( 
		.in1(a), 	// Port"in1"connects to wire "a"
		.in2(b),	// Port "in2" connects to wire "b"
		.out(out)	// Port "out" connects to wire "out" 
				// (Note: mod_a's port "out" is not the same as top_module's wire "out". 
				// It is simply coincidence that they have the same name)
	);

/*
	// Create an instance of "mod_a" named "inst1", and connect ports by position:
	mod_a inst1 ( a, b, out );	// The three wires are connected to ports in1, in2, and out, respectively.
