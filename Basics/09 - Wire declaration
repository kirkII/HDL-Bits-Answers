//Implement the following circuit. Create two intermediate wires (named anything you want) to connect the AND and OR gates together.
//Note that the wire that feeds the NOT gate is really wire out, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here. 
//Notice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but can feed multiple inputs.

//If you're following the circuit structure in the diagram, you should end up with four assign statements, as there are four signals that need a value assigned.
